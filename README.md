# professional-README-generator

## Description

This project consists of a command-line-interface application used for generating a professional README markdown file based on answers provided by the user. Upon starting the application, the user is presented with a series of prompts required for filling in the necessary sections in the README file. Upon generation, the README markdown file is saved within the output folder.
